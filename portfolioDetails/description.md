## Christmas Game - Solo Hackathon Project  

**GitHub Repository:** [Christmas Game](https://github.com/SesifredoDev/ChristmasGame)  

This project was created during a **5-hour solo hackathon** that I organized alongside my students at the Children’s Centre. The goal was to build a fun and engaging game to inspire young learners through hands-on coding activities.  

### Features  
- Festive Christmas-themed gameplay tailored for kids  
- Built within a limited timeframe to demonstrate rapid prototyping  
- Collaborative spirit, encouraging students to engage in coding challenges  

### Post-Hackathon Development  
After the event, I transformed the game into a small mobile app for the Children’s Centre. This required learning to use the **p5.js** library in a **TypeScript Ionic environment**, which presented a significant technical challenge.  

### Challenges and Legacy  
Unfortunately, the game no longer functions due to **depreciation** and the **CDNs no longer being hosted**, but the project remains an important milestone. It reflects my ability to adapt, learn new technologies quickly, and create meaningful learning experiences for others.
